You are an expert trader and programmer. I require assistance writing an algorithmic trade signaler in python.
Here is some information below on what I'm trying to accomplish.

The data you received is a few months of hourly data from ETH/USD and BTC/USD
We know the ETH can sometimes lag behind BTC price action wise
Apply several different trading strategies using different trading signals such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Volume, VWAP, DCA and others.
Combine several of these signals to see if any buying opportunities were created when more than 1 signal was active.
Determine the best buy / sell points within this price history when applying the above trading strategies
1000 will be my start position and I will trade 5% of that at a time. So if I can 5% on a trade I will trade 5% of my total position.
There will also be a 10% stop loss in play, with no position being sold other than at break even or higher, unless the stop loss itself is triggered.
A buy signal above a previous buy signal will also trigger an immediate sell.
I would like to know what my cumulative return $ and % wise would be on each pair
I would like to see all my trades plotted on a chart visually as well.
I don't want to overtrade and I only want to take the highest quality trades so don't place more than 2 trades a day.

Please add all the above information to my python script below:
